# AndroidSensors
This is an app where it explores the sensors of an android and shows my understanding of sensors.  
It is has three parts.

1. First part is a graph that maps the accelerometer and linear_accelerometer data.
2. Second part uses the light sensor to raise the volume of your cellphone.
3. Third part and my favorite , uses sensor fusion which combines the accelerometer or gravity sensor with the magnometer to detect the x-axis rotation and y-axis rotation of the device.
